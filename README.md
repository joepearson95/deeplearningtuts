Brushing up on deep learning/machine learning generally. Going over PyTorch/TensorFlow
I will be following a PyTorch deep learning tutorial from "sentdex" on YouTube to begin with. This will be using the MNIST images datasets. This is all to help me brush up on my rusty skills before I go doing some cool side projects.
